## Day 1 – Learning Python Basics

What I learned:
- I start learning python in freecodecamp's 'Python for Beginners - Full Course'.
- def, tuples, dictionary, sets, function, variable scope, nested functions, closures, object, while&for loop, continue&break, classes, module

What confused me:
- How do the nested functions work with other code?
- I have difficulty in learning classes, how it work? I thought that classes mix with def, parameter, argument. mostly, I can't understand why and how `self` work in classes.
What I realized:
- ~~I have more understand in the game of "Rock, Scissors, Paper"~~.
- I should not learn fast but slow, which means I should follow this study flow: Listen what the teacher teach and type his code in my IDE — Run the Code — success or not, I should destory my code, like delete what is inside the `( )`, the parameter — Watch how the program complain to me that he encounters an error — I think, and I explain why he complain to me with that error — input that explain and error to AI assistant, and AI's feedback can help me have a deeper understand of that code logic — Let AI output some similary example, and I type that example letter by letter — repeat that typing action — I turely understand how it work!
Questions:
- I feel tired, can I persist recording what I learn everyday in English, That sounds crazy because Today's English output have been outweight the sum of last two months!
